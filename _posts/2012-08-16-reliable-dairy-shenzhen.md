Dairy consumption might be easy in some areas or countries, but buying milk and cheeses would be different in Shenzhen. The following is about how to buy good milk brands in Shenzhen downtown.

I happened to recognize it as a problem to some expats here in Shenzhen. Few months ago while I was shopping in the grocery mart in a Rainbow Department Store, I met two Africans wandering around some fridges confusedly. In time by a greeting I knew that they were looking for yoghurts.

Obviously Shenzhen is still not ready for an International  Metropolis, that by one point  English signs and services are poorly absent. By the conversation I realized the visitors had found few of yoghurts but most of the dairy products were local brands and sounded unfamiliar to them. Hard to made choices, yes.

One that I recommended to the guests is Chenguang Milk (晨光牛奶). Ten years ago it was difficult to find but in it's dairy store, whilst Chenguang advertises in HK Metro everywhere as majority of their products were exported to Hong Kong.

Another reliable milk or yoghurt is Flower Fresh (香满楼), whom has been owned by a Hong Kong Holding [Lark International](http://www.lark.com.hk/dairy.htm). Mr. Ira Kaye and his wife runs Canton American Flower Lounge Livestock Company Limited, which is the largest dairy farm in the South China.

There're plenty of cheese or milk products in Australian or Canadian supermarkets, such as Coles, Woolworth, Sobeys, or Costco. Although their are other dairy product brands availble in Shenzhen, Chenguang and Xiangmanlou Milk are my reliable.
